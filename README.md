# SuperMarioBros
A work-in-progress remake of the original Super Mario Bros. for NES, in the browser using canvas and P5JS.

(Comes in a NodeJS server, only because I like using Pug. NodeJS isn't important to the project, it can be run on any server)

## Progress
1. [Basic asset loading, movement and camera work made](http://i.imgur.com/WgcUSEh.gifv)
2. [Resized the canvas and repositioned the ground tiles to better match the original Mario game](http://i.imgur.com/0GFAbRo.gifv)
3. [Brick shattering animation added](http://i.imgur.com/XFT7NvN.gifv)
4. [Sounds, music and rough block states (sound warning)](https://youtu.be/i4Z-SBa1dcw)
5. [Changed player sprite to be Mario](http://i.imgur.com/n8PbQ8q.gifv)
6. [Added "Super" Mario and the different jump sound (sound warning)](https://youtu.be/dezm86BU1kI)
7. [Started adding proper block states, block types, small Mario cannot break blocks anymore (only "Super" Mario)](http://i.imgur.com/PY81ux6.gifv)
