# SuperMarioBros
A work-in-progress remake of the original Super Mario Bros. for NES, in the browser using canvas and P5JS.

(Comes in a NodeJS server, only because I like using Pug. NodeJS isn't important to the project, it can be run on any server)

## Progress
1. [Basic asset loading, movement and camera work made](http://i.imgur.com/WgcUSEh.gifv)
